Steps for the Love Calculator Program

    Import the random Module:
        Purpose: The random module is used to generate random numbers, which in this case is used to simulate a random "love score."
        Code: import random
        Explanation: This statement imports the random module so you can use its functions, like randint, to generate random numbers.

    Define the love_calculate Function:
        Purpose: The function encapsulates the logic of the love calculator. It handles user interaction and generates the love score.
        


python code:

import random
def love_calculate():
  print('welcome to love calculator')

name1=input('enter the first name:')
name2=input('enter the second name:')
love_score=random.randint(1,100)
print(f'the percentage of love b/w { name1 } and { name2 } is {love_score}%')
love_calculate() 

output:
enter the first name:anjanadri
enter the second name:Olivia Rodrigo
the percentage of love b/w anjanadri and Olivia Rodrigo is 71%
welcome to love calculator.




Explanation:

    Import the random Module: This is done correctly.
    Define love_calculate Function: The function is defined to print a welcome message, take user input, and calculate a random love score.
    Call the Function: The love_calculate() function is called at the end to execute the program.
